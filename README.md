# MultiRoute-Optimizer-for-Multi-Vehicle-Delivery-System
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) for multiple vehicles. The algorithm optimizes the delivery routes from a central depot to multiple locations, minimizing the total travel distance and balancing the workload among the vehicles.
